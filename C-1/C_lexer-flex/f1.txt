There are several approaches. The ones I recommend are.

Provide your own yywrap() function.Since my compilers 
usually allow multiple source files, I prefer to define
my own yywrap(). I'm compiling with C++, but the point 
should be obvious. If someone calls the compiler with
multiple source files, I store them in a list or array
# include <f2.txt> 
, and then yywrap() is called at the end of each 
file to give you a chance to continue with a new file.
NOTE: getNextFile() or compiler->getNextFile() are my 
own functions, not flex functions.
